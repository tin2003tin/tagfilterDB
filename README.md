# TagFilterDB Project

## Overview

TagFilterDB is a advanced database system. It designed for efficient tagging and filtering of multidimensional data, uses dynamic data management and powerful querying capabilities to handle complicated datasets. This database is designed to optimize both spatial and non-spatial searches, and it supports a broad range of data types and structures, TagFilterDB provides complete data management and impressive performance for a variety of analytical applications by including R-tree structure visualization tools and interface with file management components.


## Components

### 1: R-Tree

**Data Structure:**  
The R-tree is a spatial indexing structure used to efficiently manage multidimensional data.

**Node Support:** 
Supports many node types for diverse data architectures. Future upgrades will provide more node kinds.

**Visualization:** 
Tools are provided to visualize the R-tree structure for easier troubleshooting and comprehension.

**Traversal:**  
Provides techniques for tree traversal, such as depth-first and breadth-first, for search and data retrieval.

### 2: DataManager

**Dynamic Collection:**  
Handles diverse data types and schemas, including custom-defined schemas.

**Tag Filtering:**  
Supports advanced tagging and filtering based on custom tags for optimized data retrieval and analysis.

**Encode/Decode:**  
Efficiently encodes and decodes data for storage and retrieval.

**Visualization:**  
Provides tools to visualize data management operations for improved monitoring and analysis.

**Custom Schema Design:**  
Allows designing data schemas using a specialized language and compiler for tailored data structures and operations.

### 3. QueryEngine.

**Question Processing:**  
Allows for efficient searching of both geographical and non-spatial data using optimized methods.

**Filtering:**  
Filters data based on range and keywords, and integrates with R-tree and DataManager.

**Optimization:** 
Implements query optimization methods like indexing and caching to improve speed.

**Result Management:** 
Formats and organizes query results, including pagination, sorting, and grouping.

**Optimization:**  
Includes query optimization techniques such as indexing and caching to enhance performance.

**Result Management:**  
Manages and formats query results with support for pagination, sorting, and grouping.

### 4. FileManager (Integrated with BufferManager, LogManager, Monitoring)

**File Management:**  
Handles file operations, including creation, reading, writing, and deletion, ensuring performance and data integrity.

**BufferManager Integration:**  
Manages in-memory buffers to reduce direct file I/O and maintain data consistency.

**LogManager Integration:**  
Maintains detailed logs of file operations, supporting recovery and debugging with write-ahead logging (WAL).

**Monitoring Integration:**  
Provides real-time monitoring of file I/O, buffer usage, and log status, with alerts and reports on system health.

**File Security:**  
Implements encryption and access control to protect sensitive data and ensure authorized access.
