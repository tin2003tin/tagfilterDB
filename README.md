# TagFilterDB Project

## Overview

TagFilterDB is a comprehensive database system designed to manage and query multi-dimensional data efficiently. Below is an overview of the core components of the TagFilterDB project.

## Components

### 1. R-tree

**Data Structure:**  
The R-tree is a spatial indexing structure for efficiently managing multi-dimensional data.

**Node Support:**  
Handles various node types for different data structures. Future updates will introduce additional node types.

**Visualization:**  
Includes tools for visualizing the R-tree structure to aid in debugging and understanding.

**Traversal:**  
Provides methods for tree traversal, including depth-first and breadth-first, for search and data retrieval.

### 2. DataManager

**Dynamic Collection:**  
Manages dynamic collections of various data types and schemas, such as `Student` with fields like `id`, `name`, and `age`.

**Encode/Decode:**  
Functions for encoding and decoding data for efficient file storage and retrieval.

**Visualization:**  
Tools for visualizing data management activities, useful for monitoring and analysis.

### 3. QueryEngine

**Query Processing:**  
Supports efficient querying with optimized algorithms for both spatial and non-spatial data.

**Filtering:**  
Provides filtering mechanisms based on criteria like range and keywords, integrating with R-tree and DataManager.

**Optimization:**  
Includes query optimization techniques such as indexing and caching to enhance performance.

**Result Management:**  
Manages and formats query results with support for pagination, sorting, and grouping.

### 4. FileManager (Integrated with BufferManager, LogManager, Monitoring)

**File Management:**  
Handles file operations, including creation, reading, writing, and deletion, ensuring performance and data integrity.

**BufferManager Integration:**  
Manages in-memory buffers to reduce direct file I/O and maintain data consistency.

**LogManager Integration:**  
Maintains detailed logs of file operations, supporting recovery and debugging with write-ahead logging (WAL).

**Monitoring Integration:**  
Provides real-time monitoring of file I/O, buffer usage, and log status, with alerts and reports on system health.

**File Security:**  
Implements encryption and access control to protect sensitive data and ensure authorized access.
