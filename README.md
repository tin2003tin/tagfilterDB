TagFilterDB Project Components

1. R-tree
   - R-tree Data Structure:
     A spatial data structure used to index multi-dimensional information.
     Supports various types of nodes (more to be added in the future).
   - Node Support:
     Various types of nodes are supported for different data types or structures.
     Future enhancements planned for more node types.
   - Utility for Visualization:
     Tools or methods to visually represent the R-tree structure.
     Helps in debugging and understanding the layout of the tree.
   - Tree Traversal:
     Functions to traverse the tree in various ways (e.g., depth-first, breadth-first).
     Used for search operations, data retrieval, and analysis.
2. DataManager
   - Dynamic Collection of Types:
     Ability to dynamically collect and manage various data types (e.g., Student with int id, string name, int age).
     Flexibility to handle different data schemas.
   - Encode/Decode Functions:
     Functions to encode data structures for file storage.
     Decode functions to read and reconstruct data from files.
     Ensures efficient storage and retrieval of data.
   - Utility for Visualization:
     Tools or methods to visualize the data being managed.
     Useful for monitoring data collection and manipulation.
4. QueryEngine
   - Query Processing:
     Supports efficient querying of data stored in the R-tree and DataManager.
     Implements search algorithms optimized for spatial and non-spatial data.
   - Filter Mechanisms:
     Allows for filtering data based on various criteria, such as range, keywords, or custom conditions.
     Integrates with DataManager and R-tree for seamless filtering of complex data types.
   - Optimization:
     Includes query optimization techniques to improve performance, such as indexing and caching.
     Reduces the time complexity of frequently run queries.
   - Result Management:
     Manages and formats query results for easy consumption by other components or end-users.
     Supports pagination, sorting, and grouping of results.
5. FileManager (Integrated with BufferManager, LogManager, Monitoring)
   - File Management:
     Handles the creation, reading, writing, and deletion of files within the database system.
     Supports efficient file I/O operations to ensure high performance and data integrity.
   - BufferManager Integration:
     Manages in-memory buffers for frequently accessed data, reducing the need for direct file I/O.
     Ensures data consistency between the buffer and the actual files on disk.
   - LogManager Integration:
     Maintains detailed logs of file operations, aiding in recovery and debugging processes.
     Supports both write-ahead logging (WAL) and other logging strategies to ensure data durability.
   - Monitoring Integration:
     Provides real-time monitoring of file I/O operations, buffer usage, and log status.
     Generates alerts and reports on the health and performance of the file management system.
   - File Security:
     Implements encryption and access control for files to protect sensitive data.
     Ensures that only authorized processes or users can access or modify files.
