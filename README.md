     Decode functions to read and reconstruct data from files.
     Ensures efficient storage and retrieval of data.
   - Utility for Visualization:
     Tools or methods to visualize the data being managed.
     Useful for monitoring data collection and manipulation.
3. StringManager
   - Constructor:
     Initializes and allocates memory for strings.
     Supports various initialization methods.
   - Move Operations:
     Supports move semantics to efficiently transfer string ownership.
     Optimizes memory usage by avoiding unnecessary copies.
   - Pointer Storage:
     Manages pointers for strings, ensuring proper memory management.
     Includes methods for accessing, modifying, and deallocating string data.
   - Utility Functions:
     A set of helper functions for string manipulation (e.g., concatenation, substring).
     Enhances string handling capabilities within the database.
4. QueryEngine
   - Query Processing:
     Supports efficient querying of data stored in the R-tree and DataManager.
     Implements search algorithms optimized for spatial and non-spatial data.
   - Filter Mechanisms:
     Allows for filtering data based on various criteria, such as range, keywords, or custom conditions.
     Integrates with DataManager and R-tree for seamless filtering of complex data types.
   - Optimization:
     Includes query optimization techniques to improve performance, such as indexing and caching.
     Reduces the time complexity of frequently run queries.
   - Result Management:
     Manages and formats query results for easy consumption by other components or end-users.
     Supports pagination, sorting, and grouping of results.
5. TransactionManager
   - Atomic Operations:
     Ensures that database operations are atomic, meaning that they are completed fully or not at all.
     Provides mechanisms to roll back incomplete operations in case of errors.
   - Concurrency Control:
     Manages access to data when multiple operations or users are interacting with the database simultaneously.
     Implements locking and isolation levels to maintain data integrity.
   - Transaction Logs:
     Maintains logs of all transactions, which can be used for recovery in case of a system failure.
     Supports auditing and tracking of changes for security and compliance.
   - Commit and Rollback:
     Provides interfaces to commit or rollback transactions, ensuring data consistency.
     Useful in scenarios where multiple related changes need to be applied together.
6. IndexManager
   - Index Creation and Management:
     Allows for the creation of indexes on various fields in the database to speed up query performance.
     Supports different types of indexes, such as B-trees, hash indexes, or spatial indexes.
   - Index Maintenance:
     Automatically updates indexes as data is inserted, updated, or deleted.
     Provides tools to rebuild or optimize indexes as needed.
   - Composite Indexes:
     Supports the creation of composite indexes that involve multiple fields, improving the efficiency of complex queries.
     Optimizes multi-criteria searches and filtering.
   - Index Optimization:
     Analyzes query patterns to suggest or automatically create indexes that could improve performance.
     Includes tools to identify and remove unused or redundant indexes.
7. BackupManager

   - Scheduled Backups:
     Provides functionality to schedule regular backups of the entire database or specific parts of it.
     Supports full and incremental backups to save storage and reduce backup time.
   - Restore Capabilities:
     Allows the database to be restored to a previous state using backup files.
     Supports point-in-time recovery, where the database is restored to a specific moment.
   - Backup Storage:
     Manages the storage of backup files, including compression and encryption options.
     Supports storing backups locally, on remote servers, or in cloud storage.
   - Disaster Recovery:
     Implements procedures and tools to quickly recover the database in case of catastrophic failure.
     Ensures minimal downtime and data loss during recovery operations.

8. FileManager (Integrated with BufferManager, LogManager, Monitoring)
   - File Management:
     Handles the creation, reading, writing, and deletion of files within the database system.
     Supports efficient file I/O operations to ensure high performance and data integrity.
   - BufferManager Integration:
     Manages in-memory buffers for frequently accessed data, reducing the need for direct file I/O.
     Ensures data consistency between the buffer and the actual files on disk.
   - LogManager Integration:
     Maintains detailed logs of file operations, aiding in recovery and debugging processes.
     Supports both write-ahead logging (WAL) and other logging strategies to ensure data durability.
   - Monitoring Integration:
     Provides real-time monitoring of file I/O operations, buffer usage, and log status.
     Generates alerts and reports on the health and performance of the file management system.
   - File Security:
     Implements encryption and access control for files to protect sensitive data.
     Ensures that only authorized processes or users can access or modify files.
